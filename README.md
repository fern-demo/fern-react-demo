# Fern React Demo

This repository demonstrates how to add custom React components to your documentation. 

**To enable this feature:** contact [Fern](support@buildwithfern.com) to have React components enabled for your organization. 

The key aspects of this demo are: 
- [`fern/components/`](./fern/components/) - the folder where the React components are defined
- [`docs.yml`](./fern/docs.yml) - where the React feature is enabled
- [`welcome.mdx`](./fern/docs/pages/welcome.mdx) - where the React component is used
